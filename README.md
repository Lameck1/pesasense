## About Project

Pesa-Sense is a small Ruby on Rails mobile web application that helps signed-up users keep track of their expenditures. If you are signed up, you will be able to record down where every money spent goes per category or group wise. Therefore, it might help with making financial decisions in the long run that can be helpful. Beside creating groups/categories for you expenditures, there is also an added feature that allows you to budget for every group just to keep you spending further in check.

        ```

  - Migrate the database
        ```
        rails db:migrate
        ```

  - This is optional, but you can run ```rails db:seed``` to quickly get setup with sample data for testing the app.

    ```
    rails server
